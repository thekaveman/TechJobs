      "question": "What are civil service exams?",
      "answer": "Civil service is a system established by the New York State Civil Service Law to help ensure that the hiring process for government is competitive and fair. The system was established decades ago to prevent government employees from hiring their friends and relatives without merit.<br><br>City jobs with similar responsibilities and qualifications are grouped together and assigned a civil service title. The City uses exams to measure a potential candidate's qualification for a particular title—a list of eligible candidates is established for each title ranked by exam scores. For most City jobs, agencies are required to hire candidates who have taken and passed a civil service exam and appear on the list."

Candidates must still interview for positions and meet any specific requirements an agency may have for a position, beyond the minimum qualifications."

      "question": "Can I apply for a City job before I take a civil service exam?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can apply for a City job before you’ve taken the exam! City agencies can hire people who have not yet taken an exam as “provisional” employees. However, once an exam has been given and the list has been established, agencies must replace provisional employees with candidates from the civil service list. So, if you plan to apply for a City job, you should plan to take an exam to ensure continued employment with the City."

      "category": "exams",
      "question": "If I am hired for a City position before I have taken an exam, do I still have to take the exam?",
      "answer": "Yes, to ensure continued employment with the City, you must take a civil service exam, even if you are hired before the exam has been administered. City agencies can hire candidates in a \"provisional\" status if there is no existing civil service list for their title. However, once an exam has been given and the list has been established, agencies must replace provisional employees with candidates from the civil service list."
